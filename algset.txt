#AlgLearn config, used for holding the algorthms you wish to practice and the mode option
#For example algorythm entry, see the ones provided already
#
#Using anything other than just the letters/numbers and ' within the alg may cause issues with the program
#Any line with a hashtag will be ignored other than the mode line
#
#The mode line defines what mode the program will run in and any additional settings for that mode
#mode 0 chooses algs randomly
#mode 1 chooses algs with higher average times, good for just learning new algs
#mode 2 chooses the alg with the lowest turns per second - probably best one to use
#mode 3 chooses any alg with an average above a set number (format: mode:3:<time to beat>)
#note - if you beat your time setting in mode 3 for all algs, it automatically decreases your time to beat
